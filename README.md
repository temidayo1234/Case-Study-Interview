# Case-Study-Interview

The Sales Enablement team discovered that the open rate for content emailed to clients via Seismic's Livesend feature is lower than expected - only 10%. They have pulled together a report of Livesends by date, by IBM sellers (senders), and by piece of content. They also tested the Livesend feature themselves and provided a screenshot of the emails. Review the tabs to help the Sales Enablement team understand:

Seismic is IBM's Sales Enablement platform. It contains a library of content that users (including IBM sellers, partners, and more) can use to educate themselves and/or send to their clients.

Livesend is a feature within the Seismic platform. It allows users to email a piece of content from the platform directly to a client.

2) What are potential actions they can take to optimize performance?
